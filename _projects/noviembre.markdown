6th of November of 1985, Bogotá, Colombia 

Just an hour after the takeover of the Palace of Justice, the army's response begins to ruin the M-19 guerilla's plans to take over the building and hold a trial against the president for failure to comply with the peace treaties. 

Amid the combat, a small group of insurgents takes refuge in a bathroom. Some civilians, locked and confined with the small guerrilla group, must endure, for close to 27 hours, the brutality of the crossfire between their captors and the state army in a confrontation in which they choose not to take part.
