In the disciplined world of boxing, Fabiana maintains order as a referee, but her life takes an unexpected turn when she decides to adopt Dudu, a troubled 12-year-old boy. To get out of this, she needs to reconnect with his father, a frustrated actor. While society favors "perfect" mothers, fathers and children, this unlikely trio faces challenges and discovers that family is much more than an ideal model.
