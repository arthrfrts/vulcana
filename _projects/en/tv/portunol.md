Portuñol dives in the culture of the border areas between Brazil and its neighbors Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela. The portuñol, a language born from the intersection of cultures, is a pretext to speak about the genesis of Latin America. A journey that goes from the south to the north of the country, undoing physical limits and unveiling the Latinicity that unites different characters. A deconstructing path that does not seek an answer, but rather to break all possible certainties of what it means to exist at the edges of cultural definitions.
