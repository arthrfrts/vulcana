Fernanda is a Brazilian living in São Paulo, Adriana is a Mexican-Brazilian living in Los Angeles, two countries and cities different from each other yet similar in the political and social chaos that 2020 brought upon them. In a period of isolation, far away from each other, they reconnect through video-letters, inspired by the poetic gaze of sixteen women experimental filmmakers.
