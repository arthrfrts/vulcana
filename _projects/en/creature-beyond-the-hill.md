In a small village in southern Brazil, little Ana becomes obsessed by a play that presents the ancient legend of the Thiltapes – a mysterious animal that hides beyond the hill. Two hundred years before, a German botanist hears the same story told by a settler. While dealing with their own demons, each character searches for the same creature.
