Bruno, a young military who has just run away from the army, travels to Porto Alegre in search of his brother, who he hasn’t seen in years. There, he doesn’t find his brother at first, but meets his friends, learns his memories, relives the situations his brother lived and discovers a space where he is free to be himself and explore his sexuality. Away from home, Bruno finds a new family.
